# Radial Blur Remover

## Description

Requested by godescalcus#8090 on Discord.

Very simple, just goes over all image space adapters and disables radial blur effects from them (by setting some values to 0).

### Settings

GUI is only available when running as Git patcher.
- Blacklist: add image space adapters to exclude them from being patched, retaining any radial blur effects they may have. Useful for keeping radial blur effects when drunk, cold etc.
